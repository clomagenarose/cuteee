Hi I'm Cristel Glenn R Licaylicay
I am 22 years old and currently residing at Zone 3, Lunocan Manolo Fortich Bukidnon.
I am studying at Tagoloan Community College and taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
It's an oppurtunity to take this course, as I am learning a lot of things on how to manipulate things specially using technologies that very in demand nowadays.Exploring programs especially this subject really help me in enhancing my knowledge in creating a webpage design.
I usually did in my free time is doing tiktok, i love dancing and reading boooks.
I have a part time its convenience to me because its near in our house also we dont have a face to face classes. Although its a little bit challenging in time management but still i fullfill balancing between studying at night and working at daytime.
